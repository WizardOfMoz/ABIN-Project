Scan Q from 0....n
BWT search on P to check if a match exists
If mismatch - LMEM - common substring of P and Q save as 4 tuple.

Sort LMEM by PosDiff - P_end - Q_start : Adjacent difference(PosDiff) < 25
This way we get sets of LMEM that are within a range of colinearity.

Sort each set by Q_start : Find same Q_start regions. Out of these, choose the one with the least adjacent difference. Remove outlier- adjacent difference(PosDiff)>5

Remove overlaps between adjacent pairs - give overlap to larger substring

Gaps identification : Consecutive difference > 200 : Find Number of common k-mers
